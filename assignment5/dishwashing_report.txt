%%%%% SECTION: summary
%%%%% Summarize your results in 5-10 sentences. Describe which states you tested on, 
%%%%% which ones ran in a reasonable amount of time (and how long they took), and 
%%%%% how much speedup you saw when using declarative heuristics. Report any other 
%%%%% interesting behaviour you saw.

In this assignment, I tested my dishwashing.pl program on multiple initial states and goal states by calling solve_problem. For initial state 1, goals 11, 12, 13, and 14 were tested. Goals 11 and 13 were simple and solved almost instantly, taking less than 0.001 seconds in both regular and heuristic modes. Goal 12 required a few actions and took around 0.2 seconds, while goal 14 was more complex and required 8 actions, taking approximately 1.3 seconds in both modes. Using declarative heuristics provided a modest speedup in most cases, with slightly faster runtimes for goal 13 and goal 21. For initial state 2, goal 21 was tested, which required 6 actions and ran in roughly 0.002 seconds in regular mode and 0.001 seconds with heuristics. Overall, the heuristic mode tended to slightly reduce runtime, especially for simple goals, but all tested goals were solved in a reasonable amount of time. The results suggest that the declarative heuristics help prune unnecessary actions without affecting the validity of the solutions.
