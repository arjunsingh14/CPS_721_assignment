# This first list shows the travel times between each pair of customers and the warehouse
# For example, travel_times[5][10] will return to the travel time in minutes between customers
# c5 and c10. Index 0 corresponds to the warehouse.
# Note that the travel time between a customer and itself is set as 0, but your delivery
# truck should never repeat the same customer more than once
# Also notice that travel_times is symmetric, and so travel_times[5][10] == travel_times[10][5]
# since the time is the same in either direction.
