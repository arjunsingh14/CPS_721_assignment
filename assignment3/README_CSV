This file has information on the CSV file formats. Remember that the data in these files
is the same as in the Python files, so it is unlikely you will need both.

----- travel_times.csv -----
This file contains the time needed to travel between all pairs of customers and the warehouse.
The first column shows the starting location for a particular step of travel. It is thus
labelled as "start" in the first row, which is the header. The remaining columns show the
time needed to reach each other customer (or warehouse which is indicated as a 'w').
For example, the fourth row --- starting with c2 --- shows the time needed to travel from
c2 to any of the other customers. The 5th entry in that row (in the column marked c3) is 35, meaning it takes 35 minutes to get from c2 to c3.

Note that the travel time between a customer and itself is set as 0, but your delivery
truck should never repeat the same customer more than once in your solution.
Also notice that the CSV is symmetric, as the time to get from c2 to c3 is the same as
going from c3 to c2. This is because travel takes the same time in any direction.


----- windows.csv -----
Each row in this file shows the time window for a different customer. The first column
shows the customer in question. The second column shows the start time. The third column
shows the end time. The first row is a header. For example, row 4 shows the time windows
for c3, which starts at time 60 and ends at time 180. Remember that the start time is 
inclusive and the end time is not.
