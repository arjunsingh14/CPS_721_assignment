The comparison of runtimes clearly shows that the interleaving approach is vastly more efficient than the standard generate and test method. For the 9-customer problem, the interleaving program was over 250 times faster, solving it in approximately 0.01 milliseconds compared to over 3 milliseconds for the generate and test version. This performance difference becomes even more extreme as the problem size increases; the interleaving approach solved the 18-customer problem in under a millisecond, a task that would be computationally infeasible for the standard generate and test method which must check every single one of the 18! permutations. This is because interleaving prunes the search by immediately backtracking after a single invalid step, whereas the standard method must generate a complete, invalid path before discarding it.
